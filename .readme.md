<b>Spring Cloud Config Server</b>

<b>Dependencies</b>
  - spring-cloud-config-server with 3.1.3 version.

This config server exposes rest api to provide properties as an output.


<b>API Structure</b>

http://localhost:8888/<project_name>/<environment> (GET request)

<b>Requesting environment specific properties</b> 

When we request for environment specific properties, properties in default file and requested environment properties will be the output. Behaviour is that first default properties will be loaded and they will be overriden by environment specific values.

Environment specific file names will be stored in <project_name>-<environment>.yml file.

<b>When changes are made to properties in txt docs, How to refresh app to take new properties?</b>

If any change happens in configuration files spring config server will automatically detect that.
